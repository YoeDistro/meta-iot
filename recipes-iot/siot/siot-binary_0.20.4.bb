SUMMARY = "Simple IoT edge and cloud application framework (upstream binary release)"
DESCRIPTION = "Simple IoT is a framework for building IoT and connected product \
systems. It runs the same binary at the edge and in the cloud, synchronizing \
state between the two. This recipe installs the prebuilt binary published by \
upstream rather than building from source."
